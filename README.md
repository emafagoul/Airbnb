Based on a Kaggle competition, the goal is, after some feature engineering, predicting the price of a flat. The explored method explored the Random Forests.

The notebook is structures in :

1. Study the data (correlation, univariate analysis,...)
2. Cleaning the data (missing values, categories,...)
3. Numericalize the data (ordinal and non-ordinal values)
4. Random Forest parameters' tests
5. OOB Test
6. GridSearch
7. Feature importance study
8. Conclusion : which model fits best

The model was tested with 2 metrics : R^2 and RMSE.
